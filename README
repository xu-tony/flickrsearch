This is a small PHP mvc framework.

The server root should point to the path ../flickrsearch/src/public/ , that index.php is the entry point.

To run phpunit just run phpunit under flickrsearch folder.

The views are easy to be separated and controlled.


TODO:
1. I need to implement a cache storage(memcache, or redis) for the same search request result for 2-5 mins
